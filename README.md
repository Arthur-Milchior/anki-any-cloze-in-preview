# Preview any cloze
![Example](ex.png)
## Rationale
When you edit a card template, you want to be able to preview it in
real time. With Cloze deletion, by default, you can only preview the
first card. That's strange, I believe.

With this add-on, you can select the cloze number you'll be
previewing.

I believe that this is mostly useful if you ever use conditions, such
as {{#c ... }} {{/c ...}} and {{^c ... }} {{/c ...}}, which show a
different content depending on the card number.

## Internal
In `aqt.clayout.CardLayout`, it changes the methods:
* `redraw`
* `setupTopArea`
* `onCardSelected`
* `updateMainArea`
The following methods are also changed, and the previous version of the
method is called.
* `__init__`
* `updateCardNames`

## Version 2.0
None
